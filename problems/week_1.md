#Week 1 Warmups

##Problem 1: Swapping varialbles
Write a program that will swap the values of two variables. That is, if we start with
```js
x == "a"; //=> true
y == "b"; //=> true
```
once the program has finished running we will have
```js
x == "b"; //=> true
y == "a"; //=> true
```
*Note:* Think about why we cant just do something like `x=y` followed by `y=x`. What goes wrong when we try to do this?


##Problem 2: Reverse a String
Write a function `reverse` that takes in a string, and returns the reverse of the string. For example:
```js
reverse('Hello'); //=> returns "olleH"
```
*Note:* You cannot use any built-in array or string methods!

##Problem 3: Stacks and Queues
How would you store a List of people who were waiting in line?
